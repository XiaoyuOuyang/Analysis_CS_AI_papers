# Analysis_CS_AI_papers 
This project analyzes 400 papers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab and investigates interesting patterns among published papers.

Goals: 
1.	Compile a sample of 400 paper from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence  Lab.  
•	URL: https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/5458/browse?type=dateissued  
•	Timeframe: focus on year 2000 to today. 
2.	Categorize authors’ nationality or ethnicity. 
3.	Categorize research topics: sub-categories within AI, e.g. facial recognition, speech recognition. 
4.	Identify patterns of nationality/ethnicity and research topics within AI across time.
5.	Randomly pick authors from the data compiled above and further identify 30 authors who are currently faculty members in top ranked universities in the US. Construct these faculty members’ career trajectories outside of academia (e.g., serve as chief scientist at Facebook).
•	You may use sources such as google scholar, faculty members' CVs, acknowledgement in the paper publication, LinkedIn, online news, personal website, institutional webpage, etc.
6.	Identify patterns of published research papers of these faculty members across time, before and after the faculty members engage in activities outside of the academia.
